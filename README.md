# Spotify_User_Playlists
Purpose: View playlists (and songs per playlist) for a given Spotify user

Details: 
  While this program was initially started with the intent of integrating Spotify playlists with Apple Music (generating identical playlists),   that was scrapped when I realized that it is $99 per year for an Apple Developer account (this is needed to call the Apple Music API). Hence,   this program simply allows the user to search Spotify for a given username and list out the playlists belonging to that user along with the     songs that make up a given playlist.
